# email-scrape

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 150be8b: Major improvements with real-world integration testing and smart email extraction:

  **Enhanced Email Validation & Extraction:**

  - Non-greedy TLD matching (2-63 chars, RFC compliant) to prevent over-matching
  - Smart case detection: stops matching at uppercase letters after TLD (e.g., extracts `info@example.com` from `info@example.comFollow`)
  - Handles emails concatenated with phone numbers (e.g., `878-5717info@example.com` â†’ `info@example.com`)
  - Allows digits before emails but prevents letter/dot prefixes
  - Enhanced `sanitizeEmail()` with mixed-case TLD rejection

  **Contact Page Discovery & 404 Fallback:**

  - Automatically discovers and scrapes `/contact`, `/about`, and similar pages
  - New `followContactPages` option (default: true) to control behavior
  - Automatic fallback to `/contact` when main URL returns 404
  - Console warnings for fallback behavior

  **TypeScript Support:**

  - Complete TypeScript declaration files for all functions

  **Real-World Integration Tests:**

  - Added actual integration tests against live production websites
  - Tests both plural `scrapeEmailsFromWebsite()` and singular `scrapeEmailFromWebsite()`
  - Verified against miltonscuisine.com, marqueesteakhouse.com, and turtlejacks.com
  - 10 unit tests + 4 integration tests, all passing
  - New npm scripts: `test`, `test:integration`, `test:all`

  **Bug Fixes:**

  - Fixed extraction of emails with long TLDs like `.hospitality`
  - Resolved issue where emails followed by concatenated text were over-matched

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a791073: Major improvements with real-world integration testing and enhanced validation:

  **Enhanced Email Validation:**

  - Increased TLD limit from 6 to 24 characters to support modern long TLDs like `.international`, `.photography`, `.business`
  - Improved regex pattern with proper negative lookbehind/lookahead to prevent matching concatenated text
  - Enhanced `sanitizeEmail()` validation to reject malformed email structures

  **Contact Page Discovery:**

  - Automatically discovers and scrapes `/contact`, `/about`, and similar pages
  - New `followContactPages` option (default: true) to control behavior
  - Limits discovery to 5 pages maximum to prevent excessive requests

  **404 Fallback Support:**

  - Automatically falls back to `/contact` page when main URL fails
  - Provides console warnings about fallback behavior
  - Intelligently avoids duplicate scraping when using fallback

  **TypeScript Support:**

  - Complete TypeScript declaration files for all functions and interfaces
  - Full type safety for IDE autocompletion

  **Real-World Integration Tests:**

  - Added actual integration tests that run against live production websites
  - Tested and verified against miltonscuisine.com, marqueesteakhouse.com, and turtlejacks.com
  - 10 unit tests + 3 integration tests, all passing
  - New npm scripts: `test`, `test:integration`, `test:all`

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 33525f6: Major improvements to email validation, contact page discovery, and error handling:

  **Enhanced Email Validation:**

  - Improved regex pattern to prevent extracting malformed emails from concatenated text (e.g., "878-5717info@example.com")
  - Limited TLD matching to 2-6 characters to prevent matching invalid domains
  - Added negative lookbehind and lookahead to ensure proper word boundaries
  - Enhanced validation in `sanitizeEmail()` to reject emails with invalid structures

  **Contact Page Discovery:**

  - Automatically discovers and scrapes `/contact`, `/about`, and similar pages for additional emails
  - New `followContactPages` option (default: true) to enable/disable this behavior
  - Limits contact page discovery to 5 pages maximum to prevent excessive requests

  **404 Fallback Support:**

  - Automatically falls back to `/contact` page when main URL returns 404 or other errors
  - Provides clear console warnings about fallback behavior
  - Intelligently skips duplicate contact page scraping when using fallback

  **TypeScript Support:**

  - Added complete TypeScript declaration files (`src/index.d.ts`)
  - Full type safety for all exported functions and interfaces

  **Real-World Testing:**

  - Added comprehensive integration tests based on actual websites
  - Tests for miltonscuisine.com, marqueesteakhouse.com, and turtlejacks.com scenarios
  - 12 total tests covering validation, discovery, and error handling
